## 2. What is `Go`?

> 1. Discussion and Demo
> 1. <https://go.dev/>
> 1. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)>

## 3. The `Go` Playground

> 1. Discussion and Demo
> 1. <https://go.dev/>

## 4. `Go` installation

> 1. Discussion and Demo
> 1. <https://go.dev/doc/install>

![Go Lang Version](../images/S1/GoLangVersion.PNG)

## 5. Install `golang.go` VS code extension

> 1. Discussion and Demo

![Go Lang VS Code Extension](../images/S1/GoLang_VSExtension.PNG)

## 6. Install/Update `go tools` in VS Code

> 1. Discussion and Demo
> 1. `gopls:` Pronounced as “Go please,” it’s the official Go language server developed by the Go team. It provides IDE features to any LSP-compatible editor. You don’t need to interact with gopls directly; it will be automatically integrated into your editor. Features and settings vary slightly by editor, so refer to your editor’s documentation for specifics.
> 1. `staticcheck:` A static analysis tool that identifies potential issues in your Go code. It catches common mistakes, inefficiencies, and style violations.
> 1. `goplay:` An online Go playground where you can experiment with Go code snippets. Great for sharing and collaborating.
> 1. `gotests:` Generates test functions for your Go code. It’s useful for maintaining test coverage and ensuring code correctness.
> 1. `impl:` Automatically generates method stubs for Go interfaces. Handy for implementing interface methods quickly.
> 1. `dlv:` A powerful debugger for Go. It helps you inspect variables, set breakpoints, and step through code during debugging sessions.
> 1. `gomodifytags:` Allows you to add, modify, or remove struct field tags in your Go code. Useful for managing serialization, validation, and other metadata.

## 7. Discussion on couple of `go tools`

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### `staticcheck`

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### `goplay`

> 1. Discussion and Demo

## 8. Few `Go` commands

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### `go mod init`

> 1. The go mod init command initializes a new Go module in the current directory. It creates a go.mod file that specifies the module’s properties and dependencies. This file includes information about the Go version and other modules required by your code. By using go mod init, you set up a module that others can import and use, making it easier to manage dependencies and versioning for your Go project

### `go run .`

> 1. The go run . command compiles and executes the Go program in the current directory. It automatically detects and runs the main package, making it convenient for testing or running small Go applications without explicitly building an executable binary .

## 9. Let's `Go` with our first go program

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### Create a `go` module

> 1. Discussion and Demo

```powershell
go mod init helloworld

go mod tidy
```

![Go Lang Module](../images/S1/GoLang_Mod.PNG)

### Create a `main.go` file, to contain the code

> 1. Discussion and Demo

```go
// FileName: main.go

package main

import (
 "fmt"
)

func main() {
 fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
